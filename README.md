# Monte Carlo Simulation
The first activity in Computational Science involves a simulation featuring either green or black as the selected colors. There is no limit to the number of simulations you can run, but you may continue until you lose all your money. Alternatively, you can choose to stop at any time and secure your earnings. Good luck, and may you win big! 💵🤑

## Win Lose Output
- **BOTH WITH** = The difference between the highest value and the lower value will be added to the player’s money
    -     => (blackBet + greenBet) + playerMoney | MORE MONEY 🤑💵🤑💵
- **WIN** = The sum of both dice is added from the player’s money
    -     => (highestBet - lowestBet) + playerMoney | WON MONEY 🤑💵
- **LOSE** = The sum of both dice is subtracted from the player’s money
    -     => (blackBet - greenBet) + playerMoney | LOSE MONEY 🥲
